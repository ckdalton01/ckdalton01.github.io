Hello World!

![my image](/cancun24-135-small.webp)

My name is Chris Dalton. I’m a Customer Engineer / Professional log reader at [Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com). I’m furiously documenting some of the fringe cases I encounter.

I don’t take this blog seriously, you shouldn’t either.

I rarely promote this in any way. If you find this page, I hope it was moderately helpful.
